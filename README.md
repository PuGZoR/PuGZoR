👋 Hi, I’m @PuGZoR

👀 Interested in a whole tonne of things, but mostly website/app analytics, adtech and marketing automation. 
🌱 Currently learning about a few different areas including Python and BigQuery. Really dipping my toes into serverside GTM too. 
💞️ Keen to collaborate on anything that interests me. I'm not terribly skilled when it comes to code, but I've got spirit, if that counts.

Also, yes, followed the generic template... because I can.
